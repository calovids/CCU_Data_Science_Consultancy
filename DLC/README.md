# CCU - Deeplabcut docker image and kubernetes pod script

Files necessary to create a custom DLC docker container and example script on how to submit create a pod in our cluster. SSH access is described but commented. If needed, the better alternative is to use a ssh-key instead of password. Have the script First_Execute.sh in the same folder as you are building your container for it work properly.
